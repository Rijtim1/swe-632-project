# Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

The **Pomodoro Timer** is a web-based productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique alternates between focused work sessions and short breaks to enhance focus and productivity.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer Durations**: Adjust focus and break times using sliders or input fields.
- **Progress Visualization**: A circular progress ring visually represents the remaining time.
- **Audio Notifications**: Optional sound alerts to signal the end of a session.
- **Presets**: Quickly set predefined focus/break durations (e.g., 25/5, 50/10).
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Settings Modal**: Configure preferences such as audio notifications and timer durations.

## How It Works

1. **Focus Time**: Work without distractions during the focus session.
2. **Break Time**: Take a short break to recharge.
3. **Automatic Transitions**: The timer automatically switches between focus and break sessions.
4. **Customization**: Use sliders or presets to adjust durations.

## Updated Functions

- **toggleModal**: A single function to open or close modals.
- **updateTime**: Synchronizes slider and input field values for focus and break durations.
